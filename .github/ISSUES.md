# Issue Guidelines

Thank you for taking the time to contribute to this repository! To ensure that issues are clear, actionable, and helpful for everyone, please follow these guidelines when creating an issue.

## Before Creating an Issue

1. **Search existing issues** - Check if your issue has already been reported or discussed
2. **Review the documentation** - Make sure your question isn't already answered in the README or other documentation
3. **Use the appropriate template** - We provide templates for bugs, feature requests, and questions

## Issue Types

We accept three types of issues:

### 🐛 Bug Reports
Use this when something isn't working as expected. Bug reports should:
- Include clear reproduction steps
- Describe the expected vs actual behavior
- Provide relevant context (browser, OS, versions, etc.)
- Include error messages or screenshots if applicable

### 💡 Feature Requests
Use this when you have an idea for a new feature or improvement. Feature requests should:
- Clearly describe the problem you're trying to solve
- Explain your proposed solution
- Consider potential alternatives
- Describe the expected benefits

### ❓ Questions
Use this when you need help or clarification. Questions should:
- Be specific and focused
- Include relevant context about what you're trying to accomplish
- Describe what you've already tried
- Be respectful of maintainers' time

## Best Practices

### ✅ DO:
- **Be specific and descriptive** - Use clear titles and detailed descriptions
- **Provide context** - Help others understand your situation
- **Be respectful** - Remember that maintainers are often volunteers
- **Follow up** - Respond to requests for additional information
- **Close resolved issues** - If you find a solution, share it and close the issue
- **Use proper formatting** - Use markdown for code blocks, lists, and emphasis

### ❌ DON'T:
- **Create test or placeholder issues** - Use a local repository for testing
- **Be vague** - Issues like "doesn't work" or "fix this" aren't helpful
- **Post duplicates** - Search first to avoid duplicate issues
- **Demand immediate responses** - Maintainers work on their own schedule
- **Go off-topic** - Stay focused on the specific issue
- **Include sensitive information** - Never post API keys, passwords, or personal data

## Issue Template Usage

When creating a new issue, GitHub will prompt you to select a template:

1. **Bug Report** - For reporting broken functionality
2. **Feature Request** - For suggesting new features or improvements
3. **Question** - For asking questions about usage or implementation

Each template includes helpful prompts to ensure you provide all necessary information.

## What Happens After You Create an Issue?

1. **Maintainer review** - A maintainer will review your issue and may ask for clarification
2. **Labeling** - Issues will be labeled to indicate type, priority, and status
3. **Discussion** - The community may discuss the issue and propose solutions
4. **Resolution** - Once resolved, the issue will be closed with an explanation

## Examples

### ✅ Good Issue Titles:
- "Bug: Profile README badges not displaying in dark mode"
- "Feature Request: Add section for open source contributions"
- "Question: How to update social media links?"

### ❌ Poor Issue Titles:
- "Help"
- "Bug"
- "This doesn't work"
- "Test issue please ignore"

## Getting Help

If you're unsure about:
- **Which template to use** - Choose the one that best fits, or ask in Discussions
- **How to format your issue** - Review the template examples
- **Whether to create an issue** - When in doubt, use the Question template

## Code of Conduct

All interactions in issues must be:
- **Respectful** - Treat others with courtesy and professionalism
- **Constructive** - Focus on solving problems and improving the project
- **Inclusive** - Welcome contributors of all backgrounds and skill levels
