## Quick Start

Before you begin downgrading your iOS device, make sure to:

1. ✅ **Backup your data** - iOS downgrades erase all data on your device
2. ✅ **Check signing status** - Apple must still be signing the iOS version you want to downgrade to
3. ✅ **Download iTunes/Finder** - Required for the restore process
4. ✅ **Download correct IPSW file** - Must match your exact device model
5. ✅ **Charge your device** - Keep battery above 50% during the process

## Important Warning

⚠️ **WARNING**: Downgrading iOS will completely erase all data on your device. Make sure you have a complete backup before proceeding.

⚠️ **SIGNING WINDOW**: You can only downgrade to iOS versions that Apple is currently signing. Once Apple stops signing a version, you cannot downgrade to it.

## Overview

iOS downgrading is the process of reverting your iPhone to a previous version of iOS. This is commonly done when:

- A new iOS version causes performance issues
- Apps are incompatible with the latest iOS
- Battery life has decreased after an update
- You want to maintain jailbreak compatibility

## Prerequisites

- A computer (Mac or Windows) with iTunes or Finder
- USB cable to connect your device
- The correct IPSW firmware file for your device
- Device battery charged to at least 50%
- Complete backup of your data
